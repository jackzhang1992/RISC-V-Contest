# RISC-V-Contest
this repo is used for development for the risc-v softcpu contest

================================================================
Memo
- initial assessing stage
   -dhrystone benchmark comparison
   -set up a ref env for qemu-riscv (drystone, zephyr porting)
   -study the existed verilog-based RV32 HW structure and performance

- Take use of existed materials(including cores) to make up a working reference baseline
   Mi-V core, tool chain, dhrystone and zephyr should work 
   benchmark result should be computed by the ref baseline.
   
   
- start to design our own cpu to take place the  Mi-V core
    isa implementation
    in-order
    branch predictor
    two or more issue core
    out of order
