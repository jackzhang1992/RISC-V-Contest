# RISC-V-Contest
this repo is used for development for riscv-v softcpu contest

Memo
- Take use of existed materials(including cores) to make up a reference baseline
   Mi-V core, tool chain, dhrystone and zephyr should work 
   benchmark result should be computed by the ref baseline.
   
- start to design our own cpu to take place the  Mi-V core
    isa implementation
    in-order
    branch predictor
    two or more issue core
    out of order
